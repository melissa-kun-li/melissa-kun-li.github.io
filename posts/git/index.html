		<p>A few days ago, I was cleaning my git history for a PR I made at my internship. My commits were quite messy: many parts of the code I&rsquo;d changed multiple times and the earlier commits no longer reflected the current state.</p>
<p>I knew you could reorder commits, squash, amend commit messages, reset the head, etc. and whatever else you needed for a basic git workflow. Before this PR, though, I had no idea you could split a commit into smaller commits, and you could do this by resetting the head and unstaging / staging specific hunks or lines.</p>
<p>Doing this in the git cli sounded like a very not fun time, so I decided to look at two tools: <code>gitk</code> and <code>git gui</code>. <code>Gitk</code> is quite nice because it visually shows you your git history and you can see each commit&rsquo;s diffs. <code>Git gui</code> on the other hand looks like a relic of the past, but it gets the job done&hellip;except when it doesn&rsquo;t. Turns out, if you have a <code>new</code> file in git, a file that&rsquo;s untracked, and you want to unstage individual lines, you simply can&rsquo;t do this with <code>git gui</code>. You don&rsquo;t get an error message either; just nothing happens. And you seemingly can&rsquo;t do this with git in general either.</p>
<p>When would this situation occur? Well, in my case I squashed all my commits together so I could split them up the way I wanted. And because I made a <code>new</code> file, I just couldn&rsquo;t unstage lines for that new file. Also imagine you need to unstage/stage a few lines in the commit where you first introduce the new file.</p>
<p>I had already pushed my commits and opened a PR, and I really didn&rsquo;t want to close that PR and open a new branch, nor did I want to commit the entire new file I wrote in one commit, so I made a somewhat hacky way to be able to unstage individual lines in a new file. It basically involves making that <code>new</code> file change status to <code>modified</code> so <code>git gui</code> can do its thing and your git history stays pristine. There are probably (definitely) more elegant or efficient ways of doing this, but I couldn&rsquo;t find any solution online, so this is how I did it!</p>
<p>Voila:</p>
<ol>
<li>git reset HEAD~ &ndash;soft (reset head to the commit before the one you want to split)</li>
<li>OR git rebase -i &lt;parent_of_commit_to_split&gt; and change the <code>pick</code> to <code>e</code> for the commit you want to split, then reset the head~ (and after you&rsquo;re done splitting the entire commit you can git rebase &ndash;continue)</li>
<li>git status (will show you <code>new file: ........</code>)</li>
<li>git reset</li>
<li>git add -N .</li>
<li>git add -p</li>
<li>for the hunk you want to edit: e</li>
<li>remove the lines you don&rsquo;t want to stage for the new commit</li>
<li>git add new_file</li>
<li>git commit -m &ldquo;??&rdquo;</li>
<li>on the file itself, remove everything out of the file except the lines you want to stage (SAVE that code you removed bc you&rsquo;ll need it later)</li>
<li>git add new_file</li>
<li>git status (will show you the file is now <code>modified</code>)</li>
<li><code>git gui</code></li>
<li>unstage those lines and make your first split commit!</li>
<li>git rebase -i &lt;parent of ?? commit&gt;</li>
<li>squash the commit you made in step 14 into <code>??</code> (and reword the commit as needed)</li>
<li>now add back those lines you removed in step 7 into the file</li>
<li>now git status should just show modified so you can split the rest as normal :)</li>
</ol>
